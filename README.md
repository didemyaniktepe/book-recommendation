# Book-Recommendation-System
Implementing a nearest neighbor algorithm to recommend books to readers best suited to their tastes and traits. Recommend books to a user based on user-item ratings.
Specifically, implement a KNN algorithm to find sets of similar users based on common book ratings, and make predictions using the average rating of top-k nearest neighbors. You will also extend your implementation as weighted k-NN algorithm.
Book ratings dataset of 1.1 million ratings of 27M books by 90K users. The ratings are on a scale between 1 to 10. Algorithm try to make predictions using the average rating of top-k nearest neighbors.
